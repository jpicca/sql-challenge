# sql-challenge

This repo contains two sql scripts for creating a table schema and then querying these tables for specific information. Also included is a notebook for some visual exploratory analysis with Python. You can find the saved images (ERD, python images) in the images folder. The sql/ipynb files are found in the EmployeeSQL folder.
